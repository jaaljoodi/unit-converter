Unit Converter

Hi, I'm Jaber -- a student at Scrimba frontend career path. This is a simple web-based unit converter that allows users to convert metric units to imperial units and vice versa. The converter supports conversion for length (meters/feet), volume (liters/gallons), and mass (kilograms/pounds). This project is part of Module 3 from the course and I built it from scratch.

Usage

Users can enter a value to be converted in the input field provided and click the "Convert" button. The converted values for the three unit types are then displayed in their respective boxes below.

Technologies Used

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The CSS file is used for styling the HTML layout, while the JavaScript file handles the logic for the unit conversions.
